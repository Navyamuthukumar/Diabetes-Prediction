# Diabetes-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to assist in early detection and provide insights that can support clinical decision-making.  We implemented and compared two algorithms:  XGBoost .
⚙️ Tech Stack

Python (ML model)

XGBoost & Random Forest for classification

Streamlit for frontend web app

Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation

✔️ User-friendly Streamlit UI
✔️ Predicts diabetes risk based on health inputs
✔️ Interactive visualizations
✔️ ML model trained with XGBoost & Random Forest
